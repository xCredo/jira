## Swimlane Chart Bar

Displays the number of tickets in every cell of the row on the swimlane bar hover.

![Chart Bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/jirahelper_ChartBar.gif)

Can be used to overview swimlane state when you have lots of swimlanes, i.e. when you have swimlanes based on Epics, Stories, or Assignees.

![Settings Base swimlane on](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/jirahelper_swimlane_base_swimlanes_on.gif)


## Flag on Issue panel

When in board view, right click on an issue to flag it.

By default, this flag won’t be shown in issue view (`jira.server.com/browse/PROJECTID-0001`)

Jira-helper extension adds flag display for issue view, right next to `priority` field.

JIRA Cloud example:
![issue flag jira cloud](https://github.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/raw/images/features/jirahelper_issue_flag.gif)

JIRA v7.*.* example:
![issue flag jira 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/jirahelper_issue_flag_jira7.gif)


## Task Description Template

Two buttons are added near the `Description` field in issue create/edit mode.

Use them to create a Template for this issue type. It’s stored locally in your browser so it isn’t shared with anyone.[More about localStorage](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/localstorage)

## WIP-limits for several columns (CONWIP)
_WIP – work in progress_

By default, JIRA allows you to set a limit for a column but doesn’t allow you to combine columns under a shared limit.

However, to visualize a Kanban system, we often need [combined WIP-limit constraints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvPzFIs-ycQ).

**Jira-helper** enables you to do this.

Set it up in the board settings by choosing columns which will share the constraint.

_"Board Settings -> Columns"_ Only the Board Administrator can save this setting.

![settings wip-limit for column](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/group-wip-limit.gif)

You are still able to use the default JIRA WIP-limits, while using the combined WIP-limits.

Combined constraint will be displayed above the column titles.

If the limit is violated, the column background will turn red.

Versions [2.1.0](https://github.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/releases/tag/2.1.0)
und above let you choose whether sub-tasks are counted in the combined WIP-limits.

Use the “Column constraint” setting to select if sub-tasks are counted.

## WIP-limits for Swimlanes

Kanban-systems may use different types of WIP-limits, including swimlane limits.

There are certain types of swimlanes which are bound only by their own WIP-constraints (i.e. Expedite).

This way, tickets in an expedite swimlane are not accounted for in column WIP.

When setting up WIP-limits using **jira-helper**, you can specify which swimlanes are not subject to the column constraints.

_"Board Settings -> Swimlane"_ Only the Board Administrator can save this setting
![swimlane wip-limits](https://github.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/blob/images/features/jirahelper_wip_limit_settings_swim_ex.gif)

Using a combination of different types of WIP-constraints, you can visualize a very complex delivery system.

## WIP-limits for Individual Team Members

Per pesrson WIP-limits are used in proto-Kanban systems.

You can set per person WIP-limits in Column settings of the board.

You can also set specific columns and swimlanes, which will be subject to this person’s WIP-limit.

## SLA-line for Control Chart

_Control Chart might just be the reason to love JIRA._

[”JIRA Control Chart and it’s mysteries” speech (rus. lang) at https://kanbaneurasia.com/](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wkuk3n1xx4yld0w/AADvVyFtucbRpQp0wiiiOUkZa?dl=0&fbclid=IwAR3NIhkRDAGytpuTmmqbjpq7eC-01Ko3KLVM8szZmS3VNsW44qlZq2tzXsQ&preview=%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BB+%D0%90%D1%85%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2+-+Control+Chart+%D0%B2+JIRA%2C+%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5+%D0%B5%D0%B5+%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BD%D1%8B.pdf)

**jira-helper** introduces a Service Level Agreement (SLA) line to your Control Chart.

This line allows you to specify the desired terms for your team’s Service Level Agreement.

Only the Board Administrator can save this setting.

Use this line without saving to analyze lead times of your system on the fly.

SLA value is displayed in days.

![sla-line for control chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/jirahelper_sla_for_controlchart.gif)

And from version [2.6.0](https://github.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/releases/tag/2.6.0), percentile of issues is displayed near the SLA-line. It is counted by the number of events on the Control Chart.
![sla-line with percentile for control chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/control_chart_sla_with_percentile.png)


## Control Chart Scale

You can analyze issue sizes using the control chart estimations scale. For example, you can check whether you can use different measurement scales (i.e. Fibonacci)

Use the dropdown list near the SLA field to choose the scale you want to check.

_The picture shows the Fibonacci scale with a size value of "6"._
![Fibonacci distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/control_chart_ruler_selected_type.png)

We can see that the leadtimes do **not** correspond to the chosen scale.
This way we can say that Fibonacci scale doesn't fit to estimate the work in this system.

## Secret data blurring

Sometimes you need to hide data about your tasks, still showing your visualization to colleagues. To do this, you can blur this data through the context menu by enabling the "blur secret data" function

![the blurring of secret data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pavelpower/jira-helper/images/features/call_context_menu_use_blurre_secret_data.png)

Result

## Card Colors

Jira has a built-in feature for highlighting cards on the board with colors based on JQL queries. However, this highlighting is limited to a thin strip on the left edge of the card.

**Jira-helper** enhances this by applying the highlight to the entire card instead of just the left strip, making card categories immediately visible.

![Card Colors Before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jira-helper/jira-helper/master/src/assets/card-colors-before.jpg)

With Jira Helper:

![Card Colors After](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jira-helper/jira-helper/master/src/assets/card-colors-after.jpg)

To enable or disable this feature, go to the board settings screen => Card Colors.


## Sub-tasks Progress

The Sub-tasks Progress feature displays a progress bar on Jira issue cards. This progress bar visually reflects the completion status of related issues:

- Tasks and subtasks within an Epic
- Subtasks of a task
- Issues linked to the current issue

**Key Features:**

- **Progress Tracking Across Hierarchies**: Visualize progress for Epics, Tasks, and Sub-tasks based on their child or linked issues
- **Configurable Column Display**: Progress bars can be enabled for specific columns on the Jira board
- **Flexible Grouping**: Group and calculate progress by fields such as Project, Reporter, Assignee, Issue Type
- **Status Filtering**: Exclude certain issue statuses from the progress calculation
- **Dependency Awareness**: Warning indicator if any sub-task is blocked or flagged

Configure in _"Board Settings -> Sub-tasks Progress"_


## Additional Card Elements

This feature adds informational badges to Jira cards to improve visibility of task relationships and timing.

### Issue Links Display

Displays related issues on cards based on link types and JQL filters.

**Configuration:**
- **Link Type**: Select the type of relationship to display (Parent, Blocker, etc.)
- **Direction**: Choose inward, outward, or both directions
- **JQL Filter**: Optional JQL query to filter related issues
- **Columns**: Select which board columns to show the relationships in

**Example Use Cases:**
- Show all child tasks linked via "is Child of" relationship
- Display issues that block the current task
- Show related ideas with specific JQL filter

### Days in Column

Badge showing how many days an issue has been in the current column. Helps identify "stuck" issues quickly.

**Configuration:**
- Enable/disable the feature
- Set warning threshold (yellow) - number of days before warning
- Set danger threshold (red) - number of days before critical warning
- Configure different thresholds per column

### Days to Deadline

Badge showing remaining days until the due date of an issue.

**Configuration:**
- Select the date field to use as deadline
- Display mode: Always, Less than X days, or Overdue only
- Set warning threshold for approaching deadlines

**Color scheme:**
- Red: Overdue
- Yellow: Due today, tomorrow, or within warning threshold
- Blue: Normal

Configure in _"Board Settings -> Additional Card Elements"_


## How to identify jira-helper requests

Your JIRA administrators can identify **jira-helper** requests
by the special request header "browser-plugin: jira-helper/{version}".
